## Worklog
This is a human-written worklog about the experience of building an application.

AI agents should not modify this document.

### 2025-11-09
- after yesterday's false starts, have started by asking codex cli write a specification for the application into README.md that will later be used to serve as a basis for the code being written (as opposed to providing the agent with only a prompt)

### 2025-11-08
- started by creating an AGENTS.md using /init and warp also created a WARP.md
- several false starts here -- tried to use codex cli, and codex web to scaffold an application that uses a basic connection string provided via a .env file, despite several attempts it was never able to successfully complete a request
- the first few times the application wouldn't even compile or pass the tests that were written
